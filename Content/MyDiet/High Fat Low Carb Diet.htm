        <h1>High Fat Low Carb Diet</h1>
        <p>The ketogenic, or keto, diet also encourages a low-carbohydrate and high-fat intake.</p>
        <p>Though there are a few variations, a ketogenic diet typically involves a person consuming no more than 5–10 percent of carbohydrates in their daily diet — this equates to about 20–50 g of carbs per day.</p>
        <p>The ketogenic diet aims to help the body achieve a state of ketosis. Ketosis occurs when there are not enough carbohydrates available for the body to use for energy, so it starts to break down fat stores to use instead.</p>
        <p>This effect typically induces weight loss and may have other health benefits for some people. However, the diet may also have side effects and scientists need to carry out further research to identify the long-term benefits and dangers of the ketogenic diet.</p>
